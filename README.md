# Journal Tool

Task based calendar & journal application for productivity tracking. I needed a way to keep track of my daily tasks but I was unsatisfied with the various productivity tools online. The new year was approaching and instead of buying a new planner or switching to a new program, I decided to build an application that allowed me to keep track of my daily productivity levels and thoughts without micromanaging my day.


# Features

  - Dynamic calendar which displays user's date & events 
  - Add & manage events 
  - Daily, weekly, and long term Goal tracking  
  - Day journal which auto-populates with goal notes and daily statistics regarding user's activities
